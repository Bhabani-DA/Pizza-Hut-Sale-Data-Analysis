# PIZZA HUT SALE DATA ANALYSIS (using SQL)

## Project Objective:
The objective of this Pizza Hut Sales Analysis project is to examine pizza sales trends using SQL queries to derive meaningful business insights. The analysis focuses on determining total order volume, revenue generation, and identifying top-selling pizzas by size, type, and category. Additionally, it explores sales distribution over time, calculates cumulative revenue, and ranks the most profitable pizza types. The project aims to optimize menu offerings, pricing strategies, and operational efficiency to enhance customer satisfaction and business profitability.

## Dataset Used:
•	[order_details](https://github.com/Bhabani-DA/Pizza-Hut-Sale-Data-Analysis/blob/main/order_details.csv)  
•	[orders](https://github.com/Bhabani-DA/Pizza-Hut-Sale-Data-Analysis/blob/main/orders.csv)  
•	[pizza_types](https://github.com/Bhabani-DA/Pizza-Hut-Sale-Data-Analysis/blob/main/pizza_types.csv)  
•	[pizzas](https://github.com/Bhabani-DA/Pizza-Hut-Sale-Data-Analysis/blob/main/pizzas.csv)  

## Question (KPI’s):
•	Retrieve the total number of orders placed.  
•	Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.  
•	Identify the highest-priced pizza.  
•	Identify the most common pizza size ordered.  
•	List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.  
•	Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.  
•	Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.  
•	Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.  
•	Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.  
•	Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.  
•	Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.  
•	Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.  
•	Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.  

## Project Process:
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the project process:  
•	Define Objectives – Establish key goals, such as understanding sales trends, revenue analysis, and customer ordering patterns.  
•	Data Collection – Gather raw data from the orders, pizzas, pizza_types, and order_details tables.  
•	Data Cleaning & Preparation – Ensure accurate data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.  
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Run initial SQL queries to get an overview of total orders, revenue, and popular pizza types.  
•	SQL Query Development – Create complex SQL queries for revenue calculations, ranking top pizzas, and determining cumulative trends.  
•	Performance Optimization – Improve query execution with joins and aggregations for efficiency.
